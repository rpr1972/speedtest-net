# Speedtest-net
Unofficial Speedtest.net docker image/add-on with integration to Home Assistant through MQTT

Although being an <u>unofficial</u> speedtest.net image, it uses the official linux client to run the tests. The results are then passed to Home Assistant via MQTT integration. The image can run on standalone docker (for those running Home Assistant in a docker container) or as a HAOS add-on.
